**4500 x 140 x 64 time-aware Web service QoS dataset**

This dataset describes real-world QoS evaluation results from 140 users on
4,500 Web services over 64 consecutive time slices (at 15-minute interval), which is created based on the raw observations of WSDream (https://github.com/wsdream/wsdream-dataset) by removing users with extremely sparse data and adding side-information of users and services. Most of users and services have geographic location information (some of them may be inaccurate). The dataset can be retrived by contacting ruibinxiong@whu.edu.cn.
